Crop Identification using Satellite data

Problem Statement
Accurate crop identification is crucial for improving agricultural productivity, enabling precision farming, optimizing irrigation, predicting yield, and supporting government schemes. Traditional field surveys are time-consuming and limited in scale. Satellite imagery combined with machine learning can provide real-time, large-scale, and reliable crop monitoring.

Proposed Solution

In South India, crops such as coconut, arecanut, vanilla, black pepper, and coffee are predominantly cultivated in small, fragmented farms known as Toota. Traditionally, government agents visit these farms to record crop details manually. While this method ensures reliable ground truth, it is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and cannot scale efficiently across regions or cropping seasons. Satellite imagery provides an opportunity for large-scale crop monitoring. Yet, open access to high-resolution data can pose security risks, and optical images are often limited by cloud cover or mixed pixels in heterogeneous farms.

Our approach combines ground survey, drone data, satellite imagery, and AI/ML techniques to create a robust and scalable crop identification system. Baseline crop data is first collected using field agents or drones, mimicking the traditional government survey. This ground truth dataset ensures accuracy and validates satellite observations. High-resolution imagery from Sentinel-1 (Radar), Sentinel-2 (Optical), and Resource SAT/EOS-4 is then integrated, aligning radar and optical data to provide a consistent spatial and temporal reference.
Key Steps in the Approach:
•	Data Collection:
Use multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite imagery (Sentinel-2, Landsat, or similar) combined with ground-truth datasets from agricultural departments.
•	Pre-Processing:
Apply atmospheric correction, noise removal, cloud masking, and image clipping based on the region of interest.
•	Feature Extraction:
Derive vegetation indices such as NDVI, EVI, SAVI, and texture features to highlight crop growth patterns.
•	Machine Learning Models:
Train supervised models (Random Forest, SVM, or Deep Learning CNNs) on labeled crop data for classification.
•	Validation:
Compare predicted crop maps with field survey samples and government datasets for accuracy.
•	Deployment:
Build a user-friendly dashboard for farmers, policymakers, and researchers to visualize crop types, growth stages, and health in near real-time.
